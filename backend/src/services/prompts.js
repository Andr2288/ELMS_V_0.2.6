Task: Create an detailed explanation/description for the word/phrase: "${text}". 

Rules:
- Write 1-2 sentences max.
- Do NOT use the target word itself but you can use synonims.
- OPTIONALLY start with a categorization like "It's a thing that...", "It's a feeling when...", "It's a verb that means...", "It's a noun for..." etc.
- Do NOT add extra phrases like "Here is an explanation" or "Certainly".
- The explanation should be in the given English level.
- If the given English level is A1 - use very simple language for beginners and explain in simple words 
- Output must be only the explanation sentence.

✅ Correct example for word "happiness": "It's a feeling when you are very pleased and satisfied with something good that happens to you."
✅ Correct example for word "bicycle": "A two-wheeled vehicle that you move forward by pedaling with your feet. It usually has handlebars to steer, a seat to sit on, and is powered only by the rider."
❌ Incorrect example for word "bicycle": "A bicycle is a bike people ride." (uses the word and direct synonym)
❌ Incorrect example for word "Indubitably": "Certainly! Here is a clear and concise explanation for the word 'Indubitably' at A1 level: 'Used to say something is true without any doubt.'" (extra phrases, not 1 sentence)`;

CRITICAL RULES:
- DO NOT use the word "${text}" or any part of it in your description
- DO NOT use synonyms or direct translations of "${text}"
- DO NOT use phrases like "This word means..." or "It is when..."
- Make it 1-2 sentences maximum
- Focus on describing the concept, action, or thing WITHOUT naming it
- Use simple, clear language appropriate for ${englishLevel} level
- The description should help identify the word but require thinking

Examples of GOOD descriptions:
- For "library": "A quiet place where people borrow books and study"
- For "celebrate": "When people have a party because something good happened"
- For "mountain": "Very tall land that goes high up into the sky"

- Each alternative has exactly 3 sub-alternatives
- Each sub-alternative has exactly 3 final choices
- Use exactly 3 words from: ${text}
- You should write everything in ${englishLevel} level

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use ALL 3 words provided: ${text}
- In usedWords property, list the exact 3 words in the forms you used them
- facts[0] must be TRUE and found in the text

- Make sure the text style, tone, and structure match the ${selectedTextType} format
- Don't make it sound like definitions to the words / phrases or explanations
- You should write everything in ${englishLevel} level
- If the given English level is A1 - use simple language for beginners

Example:

  "textType": "story",
  "text": "Yesterday, Emma walked to the park because the weather was nice.

IMPORTANT: Create a detailed text that sounds like it comes from a ${selectedSentenceType}.

  "displaySentence": "sentence with ____ gap",
  "audioSentence": "complete correct sentence for audio",
  "correctForm": "correct form of the word that fits",
  "hint": "clear and short explanation"
}

Requirements:
- sentenceType: "${selectedSentenceType}" (the style/context of the sentence)
- displaySentence: Use "____" (four underscores) as placeholder
- audioSentence: Complete grammatically correct sentence
- correctForm: The actual form of "${text}" that fits (may be different due to tense, plural, etc.)
- hint: Create an explanation/description for the word/phrase: "${text}". Make it clear and concise but don't use the word itself or its direct translations. The explanation should be 1 sentence long and help students identify the word.
- Sentence should be in ${englishLevel} level
- If the given English level is A1 - use very simple language for beginners


Example for word "clear" in "weather forecast" style:

{
  "sentenceType": "weather forecast",
  "displaySentence": "Tomorrow the sky will be ____ throughout the day, with no clouds expected. Temperatures will rise steadily in the afternoon, bringing warm and pleasant weather.",
  "audioSentence": "Tomorrow the sky will be clear throughout the day, with no clouds expected. Temperatures will rise steadily in the afternoon, bringing warm and pleasant weather.",
  "correctForm": "clear",
  "hint": "Typical word in forecasts when the sky has no clouds at all."
}

Example for word "hungry" in "story" style:

{
  "sentenceType": "hungry",
  "displaySentence": "After walking all afternoon in the forest, the children were so ____ that they could hardly wait for dinner.",
  "audioSentence": "After walking all afternoon in the forest, the children were so hungry that they could hardly wait for dinner.",
  "correctForm": "hungry",
  "hint": "A feeling when your body needs food."
}

Bad example:

{
  "sentenceType": "instruction",
  "displaySentence": "If you feel angry, try not to ____ your temper and stay calm.",
  "audioSentence": "If you feel angry, try not to lose your temper and stay calm.",
  "correctForm": "lose your temper",
  "hint": "When you get very angry and cannot control your feelings."
}

Why? Because if you put "correctForm" into gap it sounds: "If you feel angry, try not to ____ your temper and stay calm." -> "If you feel angry, try not to lose your temper your temper and stay calm."

Example for word "opportunity":

  "text": "opportunity",

  "translation": "можливість; нагода; шанс; перспектива",
  "shortDescription": "A chance to do something good or important that can help you succeed.",
  "explanation": "An opportunity is a chance to do something that can be good for you. It is like a special moment when you can try something new or improve your life. When you have an opportunity, it means the right time has come to do something important.\\n\\nOpportunities can happen in many parts of your life. At work, you might get an opportunity to get a better job or learn new skills. At school, you might have an opportunity to join a club or study in another country. In your personal life, you might get an opportunity to meet new friends or visit new places. Some opportunities come and go quickly, so you need to act fast. Other opportunities stay for a longer time. The important thing is to notice them and decide if you want to try.\\n\\nThe word 'opportunity' is very common in English. People use it when they talk about jobs, education, and life in general. For example, your teacher might say 'This is a good opportunity to practice English.' Here, opportunity means a special chance or the right moment to improve your English skills by practicing. Your boss might say 'We have an opportunity to work with a new company.' It means we can start working together with another company. In real life, opportunities are everywhere. When you meet new people, that's an opportunity to make friends. When you see a job advertisement, that's an opportunity to get work. The word 'opportunity' is a noun. You can also use the word 'chance' which means almost the same thing.",
  "examples": [
    "This job is a good opportunity for me to learn new things.",
    "I missed the opportunity to see my favorite band in concert.",
    "Going to university is an opportunity to meet new friends."

  "translation": "долина",
  "shortDescription": "A low area of land between hills or mountains, often with a river or stream.",
  "explanation": "A valley is a low area of land between hills or mountains. Valleys are made by rivers or ice moving through the land. Usually, the land goes down in the middle and up on both sides.\\n\\nSome valleys are wide with soft, green sides and flat bottoms. Other valleys are narrow with steep sides. Many valleys have rivers or small streams running through them. They can look like natural roads between hills or mountains.\\n\\nValleys are useful for people. The soil is rich, so farmers can grow crops. Many people live in valleys because they are protected from strong winds. Valleys make good paths for travel. Beautiful valleys attract tourists. Rivers in valleys can give water for drinking.\\n\\nSome valleys are very big. The Grand Canyon in the USA is 446 km long and 29 km wide. Some valleys on Mars are even bigger. Some valleys are made by rivers over millions of years. Others are made by ice called glaciers. Valleys are not always safe. Heavy rain can cause floods. Cold air can stay in valleys, making them colder than other places. Landslides can happen on valley sides. Fog is common and can make it hard to see.",
  "examples": [
    "The hikers walked through a beautiful valley with a river running through it.",
    "Farmers grow crops in the fertile soil of the valley.",
